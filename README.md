# Goal Awkward Portfolio Project
### [Live Demo](https://goal-a.firebaseapp.com)

Goal Awkward is a goal tracking website (currently desktop only) that leverages the power of embarrassment and fear of social consequences to help people achieve their goals. When users register a goal, they also type out a secret, admission, or disclosure along with the name and email of someone they wouldn't want seeing it. The "secret" is then encrypted and the accountabilibuddy (accountability + buddy) is sent instructions via email on [how to access the secret](https://goal-a.firebaseapp.com/accountability/ysQMrka0omWRREgJXY5ac7o3Zyv1/c9e968fd-c9f3-4950-bd9b-009dbab3de23) if the sender ever fails to check in.


## About
This is a personal project and portfolio piece by me, Morgan Wongsuwan. I wanted something to really showcase my technical ability and ability to pick up new things, and I think this piece does just that. I also get a hoot out of the idea of blackmailing yourself, though I'm not banking on mass appeal.
